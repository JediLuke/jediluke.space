          <p>
            So I started coding, not expertly yet. But, I'm planning to be a
            decent coder at the very least with the help of multiple Google
            search, video tutorials, and guidance by Luke (the mastermind of all
            these!). So let me take you on my journey to coding and how YOU too
            can follow the path I'm taking!
          </p>
          <h2>How I started</h2>
          <p>
            Being given a chance to try my hands into coding and work as a
            virtual assistant for an Aussie senior software developer, rekindled
            my interest in computer programming. I didn't finish my degree in
            Information Technology in college due to unforeseen circumstances.
            It was hard, it wasn't easy and it sucks!
          </p>

          <p>
            But being a problem solver, I looked for alternative ways to learn
            anything that inspires me, whether its history, geography, science,
            fiction, or technology, relying on Google and Youtube is the closest
            I could get. That's how I learn things before and up to now. Of
            course, if my internet connection permits me to anyway!
          </p>

          <p>
            Having someone to reinforce my learnings virtually is a big help for
            me. Luke's been very generous in providing me online courses in web
            development and computer programming, as well as his knowledge in
            the field. I started with Coursera's Introduction to HTML5, where I
            learned how to make an HTML5 website from scratch. Although anyone
            can make a fully functional website through WordPress, Wix,
            Squarespace, and other platforms and website builders out there with
            just drag and drop features, coding your own website can be
            fulfilling in some ways.
          </p>

          <p>Developer.mozilla.org defines HTML5 as:</p>
          <blockquote>
            "a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on
            the World Wide Web. It is the latest evolution of the standard that
            defines HTML. The term represents two different concepts. It is a
            new version of the language HTML, with new elements, attributes, and
            behaviors, and a larger set of technologies that allows the building
            of more diverse and powerful Web sites and applications."
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Having background knowledge about how a simple page or application
            was built, knowing all the codes behind it, will give you the
            ability to fix or troubleshoot when you encounter errors when
            running your site or app.
          </p>
          <p>
            Would it be beneficial if you are your own web or software
            developer? It must be exciting and cost-effective, right?
          </p>
          <p>
            Will you be surprised that a simple page like this below contains a
            few HTML elements and tags so you can be able to view it on your
            browser?
          </p>
          <p>
            Wikipedia defines the HTML element as:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            "a type of HTML document component, one of several types of HTML
            nodes. An HTML document is composed of a tree of simple HTML nodes,
            such as text nodes, and HTML elements, which add semantics and
            formatting to parts of the document. Each element can have HTML
            attributes specified."
          </blockquote>
        </section>
        <section id="post-body">
          <p>
            So, in a simple web page or HTML document, it consists of multiple
            HTML elements, defined by an opening tag, content, and a closing
            tag.
          </p>
          <p>
            To display "Hello World!" in the the first line of your web browser,
            you need to have these codes:
          </p>
          <code class="code">
            <span class="code-line">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
            <span class="code-line">&lt;html&gt;</span>
            <span class="code-line" id="c1">&lt;head&gt;</span>
            <span class="code-line" id="c2"
              >&lt;title&gt;<span id="w">Hello World</span>&lt;title&gt;</span
            >
            <span class="code-line" id="c1">&lt;head&gt;</span>
            <span class="code-line" id="c3">&lt;body&gt;</span>
            <span class="code-line" id="c4"
              >&lt;h1><span id="w">Hello World!</span>&lt;h1&gt;</span
            >
            <span class="code-line" id="c3">&lt;body&gt;</span>
            <span class="code-line">&lt;html&gt;</span>
          </code>
          <p>
            See the definition and usage of each tag below:
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The <span id="tag">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span> - each HTML document
            starts with this Document Type Declaration, which tells the web
            browsers the version of the markup language in which a web page is
            written.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <span id="tag">&lt;html&gt;</span> tag - represents the "root"
            of the HTML document. All the HTML elements and tags will be placed
            inside these tags so that our page will be displayed by web browsers
            correctly.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <span id="tag">&lt;head&gt;</span> tag - is placed between the
            &lt;html> tag and the &lt;body> tag, which serves as a container of
            the metadata of the HTML document. Metadata defines the document
            title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information
            that are not displayed on the browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <span id="tag">&lt;title&gt;</span> tag - specifies the title of
            the document that is shown in a browser's title bar or page's tab
            and will be visible in search engine results pages as a clickable
            headline for a given result. Also, it's one of the most important
            elements of usability, SEO, and social sharing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <span id="tag">&lt;body&gt;</span> tag - defines the document's
            body, which contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as
            headings, paragraphs, images, videos, hyperlinks, tables, lists,
            etc., that are visible in your web browsers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <span id="tag">&lt;p&gt;</span> tag - defines the blocks of
            paragraph text. The browsers always add margin automatically before
            and after each <span id="tag">&lt;p&gt;</span> tags or paragraphs.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you can see, each element has an opening and closing tags. There
            are also elements with no closing tags, known as empty tags such as
            <span id="tag"
              >&lt;br&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, &lt;hr&gt;, &lt;link&gt;, &lt;meta&gt;,
              &lt;source&gt;</span
            >etc.
          </p>
          <h2>Why am I telling you all these?</h2>
          <p>It's simple!</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Creating your own piece of a web page from scratch can be a
            combination of pride and a challenge. Pride, because you make it by
            yourself. Challenge, because you won't stop by simply completing the
            codes that build up a website. You'll find yourself wanting to
            improve it when you see other people's work.
          </p>
          <p>
            How does it make it attractive, responsive, interactive, and
            mobile-friendly? You might need to explore related topics such as
            CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, and everything about web development. Of
            course, if you're really serious about becoming the next big thing
            in the industry!
          </p>
          <p>
            You'll know there's more into it. Next thing you know, you'll have
            the desire to build your own online game!
          </p>
          <p>
            Have you heard the mobile game
            <span id="tag">"Flappy Bird"</span> that was very popular in 2014?
            It was very addictive and I was scared that my friends will smash
            their phones on the wall. Why? Each round only lasts a few seconds
            before the bird reaches a few pipes! Game over!
          </p>
          <p>
            Surprisingly, the creator made this game in just two to three days,
            released in 2013 and received sudden popularity in 2014 with $50,000
            earnings a day from in-app advertisements and sales.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hah! Imagine creating a viral, yet simple mobile game like that!
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't get me wrong. I, myself, still have lots to learn. Creating
            this page took me lots of deleted codes, opened tabs of Google
            searches, video tutorials, time, and efforts just to have you
            reading this article.
          </p>
          <p>
            It can be frustrating, it can be intimidating, it can be tough!
          </p>
          <p>
            All these mixed emotions in between getting started with programming
            and being job-ready competent, if you're aiming to become a future
            software developer or web developer, will become a pool of despair.
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting it is tough. Surviving it is tougher! So, how you will
            survive? This question is more specifically thrown to me.
          </p>
          <h2>How will I survive it?</h2>
          <p>
            Did I mention I have a mastermind behind all these?
          </p>
          <p>
            It's Luke!
          </p>
          <br />

            along your journey to coding. Because, why not? Having someone to
            guide you make wonders!
